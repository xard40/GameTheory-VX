# Algorithmic Game Theory in Blockchain: A CyberKongz Case Study

This repository documents a personal research and development journey into the application of Algorithmic Game Theory (AGT) within blockchain ecosystems, with a primary focus on studying the CyberKongz NFT project and its associated mechanics.

## Project Description

This project is a deep dive into understanding how principles of game theory, particularly algorithmic game theory, manifest and can be analyzed within the dynamic and incentive-driven environments of blockchain applications and NFT ecosystems. Using CyberKongz (including Play & Kollect, tokenomics, and marketplace interactions) as a rich, real-world case study, I aim to develop expertise in identifying game-theoretic scenarios, modeling player behavior, analyzing incentives, and potentially exploring mechanism design concepts in a decentralized context.

## Motivation and Goals

The motivation behind this project is to bridge theoretical game theory concepts with the practical, often complex, interactions occurring on blockchains. CyberKongz, with its Play & Kollect game loop, $BANANA and Kongium tokenomics, and active marketplace presence across platforms like OpenSea, Blur, and Ronin Market, presents a fascinating micro-economy ripe for game-theoretic analysis.

Key goals include:

* Applying core game theory concepts (strategies, payoffs, equilibrium, etc.) to specific CyberKongz mechanics.
* Exploring algorithmic aspects of game theory, such as analyzing the efficiency of outcomes or designing simple algorithms to model or predict behavior based on incentives.
* Developing data analysis and simulation skills to study player interactions and market dynamics within the CyberKongz ecosystem.
* Building a portfolio of research notes, code snippets, and analyses demonstrating an understanding of blockchain game theory.
* Deepening expertise in this intersection of computer science, economics, and blockchain technology.

## Scope of Study

This repository will cover analyses related to, but not limited to:

* **CyberKongz Play & Kollect:** Incentives for participation, strategies for maximizing Kongium and $BANANA earnings, the role of HP and Gear Score as strategic resources, potential game-theoretic models of Adventure Runs and encounters.
* **CyberKongz Tokenomics ($BANANA & Kongium):** Analyzing the supply and demand dynamics of $BANANA and Kongium through a game theory lens, studying how token sinks and faucets influence player behavior and economic stability.
* **NFT Marketplace Dynamics (OpenSea, Blur, Ronin Market):** Applying game theory to study bidding strategies, listing price decisions, floor price dynamics, and the impact of different marketplace mechanisms on CyberKongz VX and other CyberKongz collections.
* **CyberKongz Breeding (Historical Analysis):** Examining the game theory behind the breeding mechanics and $BANANA burn when it was active.
* **General Blockchain Game Theory:** Exploring broader concepts of game theory as applied to decentralized systems, smart contracts, and protocol design, using CyberKongz as a concrete example.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized to reflect the ongoing research and development process:

* `/code`: Python scripts and other code for data retrieval, analysis, simulations, and bot development (e.g., the Telegram bot for fetching VX info and potentially market data).
* `/research_notes`: Markdown files or notebooks containing theoretical explorations, concept definitions, and literature reviews related to game theory and blockchain.
* `/data_analysis`: Scripts, notebooks, and potentially raw or processed data for analyzing CyberKongz on-chain activity, marketplace data, or game outcomes (be mindful of data storage and privacy).
* `/simulations`: Code for running simple game-theoretic simulations or models based on observed CyberKongz mechanics.
* `/findings`: Summaries of key insights, conclusions, or observations drawn from the research and analysis.

## Technologies and Tools

* **Python:** The primary programming language for data analysis, scripting, and bot development.
* **`python-telegram-bot`:** For developing the Telegram bot to interact with CyberKongz APIs and potentially market data APIs.
* **`requests`:** For making HTTP requests to APIs.
* **`python-dotenv`:** For securely managing environment variables.
* **Libraries for Data Analysis:** (e.g., `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`) for data manipulation and visualization.
* **Web3 Libraries:** (e.g., `web3.py` for Ethereum, potentially Ronin-specific libraries if needed) for interacting with blockchain data and smart contracts (more advanced).
* **Jupyter Notebooks:** For interactive research and analysis.
